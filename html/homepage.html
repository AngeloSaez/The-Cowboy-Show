            I am passionate for making art. I love to program, make art,
            make music, come up with stories, and find ways to combine all 4
            of those. One of my favorite ways to combine all of those is with
            game development, but this time... its a website!

            The Cowboy Show is a fictional TV show that I came up with that
            is one of the many secrets of this website. I wanted to fill this
            site with the various entries of my portfolio and hide secrets of
            the elusive Cowboy Show within each of these portfolio.
