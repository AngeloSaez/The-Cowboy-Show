              p 
                | My name is Angelo Saez and I am 
                | one of the most creative computer science students you will meet.
                | I am passionate for making art. I love to program, create art, 
                | make music, come up with stories, and find ways to combine 
                | all four of those. One of my favorite ways to combine all of 
                | those is with game development, but this time... it's a website!

              p 
                | This is my portfolio site where my numerous projects will go. 
                | Since I make projects in a ton of different mediums, a custom 
                | website was the most logical way to present them in one place.
              br
              p And everyone has a portfolio site. But I'm not everyone.

                | So my portfolio site will SOMEDAY host countless hidden secrets to a 
                | fictional TV show that I decided to call The Cowboy Show, where 
                | the only way to find out about this show would be to dive into 
                | the artistic overgrowth of my portfolio.
