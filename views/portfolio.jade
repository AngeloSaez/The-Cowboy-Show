                | Over the summer I taught programming in various 
                | languages to students in a wide age range. Additionally, 
                | I shadowed veteran instructors and sent parents detailed 
                | reports every lesson.

                | SGDC Game Jam Winner! This was a stationary "run" and gun arena 
                | shooter. This game boasted a quirky art style with two-frame animation 
                | and microsoft-paint-inspired artwork. 32/48 hours of the contest I 
                | publicly streamed live on YouTube.

                | Procedural content generation technology in videogames inspired me 
                | to try to apply that to music generation. So I studied up on music theory 
                | and learned who the music professors where so I could email them any
                | questions. I presented the surprisingly good result to my followers on 
                | Instagram by prompting them to enter any number where I would then 
                | showcase the song that the computer would generate using it as a seed.
